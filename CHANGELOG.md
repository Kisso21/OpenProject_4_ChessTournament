## Must to have
- specify the version of python in the README.md 3.12> or 3.11 > etc (problem with __init__.py)
- use __init__.py in the package (even if requires)
- use ```main()``` function
- add docstring, comments, inter lines in the code => more readibility

### Nice to have
- some filenames not accurate 
- listSortedPlayers ==> OK for JS => list_sort_players for python (camel case vs snake case) BUT nice basis for namimg convention
- avoid to much indetantion (4/6 MAX) => if so use su functions
- use top level package such as ```chess``` or ```src``` => better for git commands and for readibility
- README.md in english (good habits)
- All code and comments IN ENGLISH (good  practice)
- Use a Changelog to keep track of mentorship changes
- use bullet list in readme
- use ```black``` ```isort``` ```pycln```
- create some ```tests/``` with files to test the code in cli
- usage of ```rich``` ``` for better cli output 
- use tinyDB 
- commit history ?!?
- NEVER USE LAST python VERSION
- Ok  - why not track of db - but not update of db from local to remote
